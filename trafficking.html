    <h2 id="about-trafficking">1. About Human Trafficking</h2>
    <p>The UN <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/protocoltraffickinginpersons.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children</a>, (2000) was ratified by 177 countries. Art. 3 of this Protocol provides the internationally recognized definition of human trafficking.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><em>(a) "Trafficking in persons" shall mean the <strong>recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons</strong>, by means of the <strong>threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits</strong> to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of <strong>exploitation</strong>. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs;</em></p>
        <p><em>(b) The <strong>consent of a victim</strong> of trafficking in persons to the intended exploitation set forth in subparagraph (a) shall be <strong>irrelevant</strong> where any of the means set forth have been used;</em></p>
        <p><em>(c) The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a <strong>child</strong> for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered trafficking in persons even if this does not involve any of the means;</em></p>
        <p><em>(d) "Child" shall mean any person under eighteen years of age.</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Thus, this crime comprises three elements: an <em>act</em>, carried out through certain <em>means</em>, for a specific <em>purpose</em>.</p>

    <p>The purpose of human trafficking is exploitation, which can take many forms, but the UN Protocol highlights four categories:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sexual exploitation</li>
        <li>Forced labor or services</li>
        <li>Slavery, practices similar to slavery, and servitude</li>
        <li>The removal of organs</li>
    </ol>

    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0; border: 1px solid #eee; padding: 1.5em; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">Sexual exploitation is the most widespread form of human trafficking in Switzerland.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 4em; line-height: 1; margin: 0; font-weight: bold;">↓</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">EDS is focusing on trafficking for sexual exploitation which is found in prostitution.</p>
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li>A 2024 evaluation by GRETA and Swiss authorities reports that “Sexual exploitation remains the predominant form of exploitation, affecting mainly women and girls,” with forced criminality and labor trafficking also increasing <a href="http://state.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state.gov</a>, <a href="https://rm.coe.int/greta-evaluation-report-on-switzerland-third-evaluation-round-focus-ac/1680b079a5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rm.coe.int</a>.</li>
        <li>The NGO ACT212 states one of the most common forms in Switzerland is <strong>“sexual exploitation – encouraging prostitution”</strong>.</li>
        <li>Swiss police statistics show that about <strong>two-thirds of identified victims</strong> from 2019–2021 were trafficked for sexual purposes, compared to labor or criminal activities <a href="https://www.unodc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unodc.org</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Each form of exploitation requires different and tailored strategies for prevention and response.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="sexual-exploitation">2. Human Trafficking for Sexual Exploitation</h2>
    <h3>Definition in International Law</h3>
    <p>Defined under <strong>Article 3 of the Palermo Protocol (2000)</strong>, and reinforced by the <strong>Council of Europe Convention (2005)</strong> and the <strong>EU Anti-Trafficking Directive 2011/36/EU</strong>, sexual exploitation is recognized as a core form of trafficking. States are obligated to prevent, protect, and prosecute.</p>

    <h3>Long-Term Psychological and Social Consequences</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Violation of Intimacy:</strong> Forced sexual acts violate bodily autonomy and create unique trauma.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Psychological Trauma:</strong> Survivors face C-PTSD, depression, dissociation, and suicidality.</li>
        <li><strong>Stigma and Isolation:</strong> Victims face intersecting stigma and discrimination impeding reintegration.</li>
        <li><strong>Forced Simulation of Consent:</strong> Victims must disguise coercion as choice, eroding personal identity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Differentiation from Other Forms of Trafficking</h3>
    <p>Sexual exploitation is distinguished by the systematic violation of sexual autonomy and intimacy, leaving unique psychological scars, though all trafficking victims suffer grave harm.</p>

    <h3>The Scale and the “Dark Numbers”</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>UNODC</strong> and <strong>GRETA</strong> note official statistics show only a fraction of cases.</li>
        <li>Fear, stigma, migration status, and misclassification conceal the true extent.</li>
        <li>The result: vast “dark numbers” of unreported cases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="link-prostitution">3. The Link between Human Trafficking and Prostitution</h2>
    <p>Prostitution and human trafficking for sexual exploitation are structurally linked through demand. Where prostitution is normalized and legally condoned, demand expands and traffickers exploit it. Conversely, policies like the Equality Model discourage demand and reduce victim numbers.</p>

    <h3>Key Legal Instruments</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>CEDAW (1979):</strong> Article 6 obliges States to suppress all forms of trafficking and exploitation of prostitution of women.</li>
        <li><strong>Palermo Protocol (2000):</strong> Article 9(5) requires States to discourage demand fostering trafficking.</li>
        <li><strong>Council of Europe Convention (2005):</strong> Article 6 obliges States to discourage demand; Article 19 allows criminalising use of victims’ services.</li>
        <li><strong>EU Directive 2011/36/EU:</strong> Article 18 requires Member States to reduce demand.</li>
        <li><strong>UNGA Resolution 77/194 (2022):</strong> Reiterates addressing demand as a structural driver of trafficking.</li>
        <li><strong>UN Convention of 1949:</strong> Declares prostitution and related trafficking incompatible with human dignity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> International and regional law consistently recognises prostitution markets as linked to trafficking. Demand fuels exploitation. States are required to adopt <strong>demand-reduction measures</strong>.</p>

    <h2 id="system-prostitution">4. The System of Prostitution</h2>
    <p>The “system of prostitution” is a societal framework that normalizes prostitution and sustains trafficking. It:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Objectifies and commodifies women, reducing bodies to purchasable goods.</li>
        <li>Reinforces patriarchal dominance, presenting women’s bodies as available for purchase.</li>
        <li>Sustains trafficking by creating demand exploited by traffickers.</li>
        <li>Is legitimized by laws, NGOs, academia, and culture, often unintentionally perpetuating the trade (<a href="https://rm.coe.int/shadowreport-switzerland/1680a45421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Council of Europe</a>, EDS Shadow Report).</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>The system of prostitution thrives in countries where it is legal and no demand-reduction measures exist.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="equality-model">5. The Equality Model</h2>
    <p>The Equality Model (Nordic Model) addresses prostitution from a gender equality and human rights perspective. It views prostitution as gender-based violence and seeks to reduce demand by criminalising buyers while supporting prostituted persons.</p>

    <h3>Core Principles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Decriminalization of prostituted persons</strong> – recognising them as victims, not criminals.</li>
        <li><strong>Exit and support services</strong> – comprehensive assistance for those wishing to leave prostitution.</li>
        <li><strong>Criminalization of buyers and exploiters</strong> – penalties for men buying sex, pimps, and traffickers.</li>
        <li><strong>Public awareness raising</strong> – education, media responsibility, and anti-sexist schooling.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Countries like Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Canada, Northern Ireland, France, and the Republic of Ireland have adopted this model.</p>
