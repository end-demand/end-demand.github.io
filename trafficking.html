    <h2 id="about-trafficking">1. About Human Trafficking</h2>
    <p>The UN <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/protocoltraffickinginpersons.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children</a>, (2000) was ratified by 177 countries. Art. 3 of this Protocol provides the internationally recognized definition of human trafficking.</p>
    
    <p><em>"For the purpose of this Protocol:</em></p>
    
    <p><em>(a) "Trafficking in persons" shall mean the <strong>recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons</strong>, by means of the <strong>threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits</strong> to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of <strong>exploitation</strong>. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs;</em></p>
    
    <p><em>(b) The <strong>consent of a victim</strong> of trafficking in persons to the intended exploitation set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article shall be <strong>irrelevant</strong> where any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) have been used;</em></p>
    
    <p><em>(c) The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a <strong>child</strong> for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered "trafficking in persons" even if this does not involve any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article;</em></p>
    
    <p><em>(d) "Child" shall mean any person under eighteen years of age."</em></p>
    
    <p>Thus, this crime comprises three elements: an <em>act</em>, carried out through certain <em>means</em>, for a specific <em>purpose</em>.</p>
    
    <p>A trafficker commits the act of transporting, harboring, transferring, or recruiting a person by using certain means. These means include the threat or use of force, coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or a position of vulnerability, or the giving or receiving of payments or benefits.</p>
    
    <p>The purpose of human trafficking is the exploitation of the trafficked person. Exploitation can take many forms, but the UN Protocol highlights four distinct categories:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sexual exploitation</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Forced labor or services</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Slavery, practices similar to slavery, and servitude</strong></li>
        <li><strong>The removal of organs</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0; border: 1px solid #eee; padding: 1.5em; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">Sexual exploitation is the most widespread form of human trafficking in Switzerland.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 4em; line-height: 1; margin: 0; font-weight: bold;">↓</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">EDS is focusing on trafficking for sexual exploitation which is found in prostitution.</p>
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li>A 2024 evaluation by GRETA and Swiss authorities reports that <em>"Sexual exploitation remains the predominant form of exploitation, affecting mainly women and girls,"</em> with forced criminality and labor trafficking also increasing, <a href="https://rm.coe.int/greta-evaluation-report-on-switzerland-third-evaluation-round-focus-ac/1680b079a5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rm.coe.int</a>.</li>
        <li>The NGO ACT212 similarly states that one of the most common forms in Switzerland is <strong>"sexual exploitation – encouraging prostitution"</strong></li>
        <li>Additionally, Swiss police statistics show that about <strong>two-thirds of identified victims</strong> from 2019 to 2021 were trafficked for sexual purposes, compared to the remainder for labor exploitation or criminal activities unodc.org</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Each form of exploitation requires different and tailored strategies for prevention and response.</strong></p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="sexual-exploitation">2. Human Trafficking for Sexual Exploitation</h2>
    
    <h3>Definition in International Law</h3>
    <p>Human trafficking for sexual exploitation is defined under <strong>Article 3 of the Palermo Protocol (2000)</strong>, supplementing the <strong>UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime</strong>, as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring, or receipt of persons by means of coercion, deception, abuse of power, or vulnerability, for the purpose of exploitation.</p>
    
    <p>The <strong>Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (2005)</strong> and the <strong>EU Anti-Trafficking Directive 2011/36/EU</strong> also recognize sexual exploitation as a core form of trafficking, emphasizing states' obligations to prevent, protect, and prosecute.</p>

    <h3>Long-Term Psychological and Social Consequences</h3>
    <p>While all forms of trafficking inflict grave harm, sexual exploitation entails specific and enduring consequences:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Violation of Intimacy</strong><br>
        Victims are forced to perform sexual acts—the most intimate sphere of a person - without consent. This repeated violation of bodily and sexual autonomy results in unique forms of trauma.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Complex Psychological Trauma</strong><br>
        Survivors often experience <strong>complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD)</strong>, depression, dissociation, and suicidality. The repetition of unwanted sexual acts, often several times daily, creates cumulative trauma not typically paralleled in other forms of trafficking.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Stigma and Isolation</strong><br>
        As highlighted in <strong>CEDAW General Recommendation No. 38 (2020) on trafficking in women and girls in the context of global migration</strong>, women subjected to sexual exploitation face intersecting forms of stigma and discrimination, impeding reintegration and access to justice.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Forced Simulation of Consent</strong><br>
        Victims are compelled to perform enjoyment, disguising coercion as choice. This enforced deception deepens psychological harm by eroding the boundary between authentic self and forced behaviour.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Differentiation from Other Forms of Trafficking</h3>
    <p>Victims of forced labour, domestic servitude, or organ trafficking also suffer violence and exploitation. However, trafficking for sexual exploitation is distinguished by the <strong>systematic violation of sexual autonomy and intimacy</strong>, which leaves psychological scars of a different order. Recognizing this does not diminish other victims' suffering but highlights the particular nature of this form of exploitation.</p>

    <h3>The Scale and the "Dark Numbers"</h3>
    <p>Sex trafficking remains vastly underreported:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>UNODC</strong> and <strong>GRETA (Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings)</strong> underline that official statistics represent only a fraction of real cases.</li>
        <li>Fear of traffickers, stigma, irregular migration status, and misclassification of trafficked women as "voluntary sex workers" conceal the true extent.</li>
        <li>The result is enormous <em>dark numbers</em>—cases that never appear in legal systems or victim support services.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2 id="link-prostitution">3. The Link between Human Trafficking and Prostitution</h2>
    
    <p>Prostitution and human trafficking for sexual exploitation are structurally linked through demand.</p>
    
    <p>Where prostitution is normalized and legally condoned, traffickers find fertile ground: demand expands, the sex market grows, and the number of trafficked women and girls increases.</p>
    
    <p>Conversely, prostitution policies - like the Equality Model - that <em>discourage demand</em> and reduce the prostitution market lead to a decrease in both potential and actual victim numbers.</p>

    <h3>What does international law say?</h3>
    <p>The following shows how the international law consistently stresses the importance of prostitution policies that aim at reducing the demand for prostitution.</p>

    <h3>Key Legal Instruments</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>CEDAW (1979)</strong> – Article 6 obliges States to suppress all forms of trafficking and exploitation of prostitution of women. General Recommendation No. 38 (2020) stresses that discouraging demand for sexual exploitation is a due-diligence obligation.</li>
        <li><strong>Palermo Protocol (2000)</strong> – Article 9(5) requires States to adopt or strengthen measures, including legislative, to <strong>discourage demand</strong> that fosters trafficking.</li>
        <li><strong>Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (2005)</strong> – Article 6 obliges States to <strong>discourage demand</strong>; Article 19 allows criminalising the use of services when the user knows the person is a victim of trafficking.</li>
        <li><strong>EU Directive 2011/36/EU</strong> – Article 18 requires Member States to <strong>reduce demand</strong> fostering trafficking and to consider criminalising the knowing use of services of trafficking victims.</li>
        <li><strong>UN General Assembly Resolution 77/194 (2022)</strong> – Reiterates the need to <strong>address persistent demand and its role in trafficking</strong>, highlighting gender inequality, poverty, and social acceptance as risk factors.</li>
        <li><strong>UN Convention of 1949 (Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and Exploitation of Prostitution of Others)</strong> – Establishes that <strong>prostitution and related trafficking are incompatible with human dignity</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <strong>Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Anti-Trafficking Convention</strong> stresses that sexual exploitation persists because there is a profitable market, created by men who purchase sexual access. This demand sustains and incentivizes trafficking networks.</p>

    <p><strong>We conclude:</strong><br>
    International and regional instruments recognise that prostitution markets and human trafficking for sexual exploitation are closely linked through demand. A larger prostitution market increases profits for exploiters, creating incentives for traffickers to supply more women and girls.</p>
    
    <p>Across CEDAW, the Palermo Protocol, the CoE Convention, the EU Directive, and reiterated by the UNGA, the <strong>demand for sexual exploitation</strong> and the <strong>systems that sustain it</strong> are <strong>structural drivers</strong> of trafficking. Where prostitution is normalised, the <strong>expected number of persons at risk (potential victims)</strong> and the <strong>number actually trafficked (real victims)</strong> rise in the absence of <strong>comprehensive demand-reduction measures</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>This is why the instruments above consistently require States to <strong>discourage demand</strong> - not just prosecute traffickers after the fact. <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-elimination-all-forms-discrimination-against-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OHCHR</a>, <a href="https://rm.coe.int/168008371d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Council of Europe</a>, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ%3AL%3A2011%3A101%3A0001%3A0011%3Aen%3APDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EUR-Lex</a></p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="system-prostitution">4. The System of prostitution</h2>
    <p>The term <em>"system of prostitution"</em> refers to a broad and structured societal framework that is socially embedded, often legally condoned, and that normalizes both prostitution itself and the societal structures sustaining it. This framework creates systemic obstacles to the elimination of human trafficking for sexual exploitation as it:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>objectifies and commodifies human beings, primarily women, reducing bodies to purchasable goods in a predominantly male‑driven marketplace</strong></li>
        <li><strong>reinforces gendered and economic dominance, perpetuating the notion that women's bodies are available for purchase — a reflection of entrenched patriarchal dynamics</strong></li>
        <li><strong>sustains and fuels human trafficking for sexual exploitation</strong></li>
        <li><strong>is supported and legitimized by legal, regulatory, and cultural systems, including state frameworks, NGOs, academia, media discourse, and public attitudes — which may unintentionally perpetuate the trade</strong> <a href="https://rm.coe.int/shadowreport-switzerland/1680a45421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Council of Europe</a> EDS Shadow Report</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong>The system of prostitution thrives in countries where prostitution is legal and no measures are in place to efficiently reduce demand.</strong></p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="equality-model">5. The Equality Model</h2>
    <p>The Equality Model, also known as the Nordic Model, is a legal framework that addresses prostitution from a human rights and gender equality perspective.</p>
    
    <p>Prostitution and the purchase of sex are considered incompatible with gender equality and human dignity. Prostitution is seen as a form of gender-based violence and a consequence of social inequality.</p>
    
    <p>Human traffickers are profit-motivated. In the prostitution market, those profits depend on buyer demand for sexual acts; without demand, trafficking for sexual exploitation cannot be sustained.</p>
    
    <p>The Equality Model addresses the root causes for this demand and its policies are focussed on <strong>reducing this demand</strong> with the long-term goal of creating a society without prostitution.</p>
    
    <p>The purchase of sexual acts is seen as an expression of patriarchal violence in which sexual consent is commodified. It is therefore punishable by law.</p>

    <p><strong>The core principles of the Equality Model are:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Decriminalization of the prostituted person:</strong> It recognizes that those in prostitution are often victims of circumstance or coercion and should not be punished.</li>
        <li><strong>Provision of comprehensive exit and support services</strong> for women to leave the prostitution if they choose to.</li>
        <li><strong>Criminalization of the buyers and exploiters:</strong> The model makes it illegal to buy sex and penalizes pimps, brothel owners, and traffickers who profit from the prostitution of others, typically from women.</li>
        <li><strong>Public awareness raising</strong> about the system prostitution and its harms. Non-sexist education in schools. Training of social workers, media coverage that aligns with the values underpinning the Equality Model.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Countries like Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Canada, Northern Ireland, France and the Republic of Ireland have adopted this model.</p>
