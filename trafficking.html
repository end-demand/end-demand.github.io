    <h2 id="about-trafficking">1. About Human Trafficking</h2>
    <p>"Trafficking in persons" shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs;</p>
    <p>The UN <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/protocoltraffickinginpersons.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children</a> defines human trafficking as a crime comprising three elements: an <em>act</em>, carried out through certain <em>means</em>, for a specific <em>purpose</em>.</p>
    <p>A trafficker commits the act of transporting, harboring, transferring, or recruiting a person by using certain means. These means include the threat or use of force, coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or a position of vulnerability, or the giving or receiving of payments or benefits.</p>
    <p>The purpose of human trafficking is the exploitation of the trafficked person. Exploitation can take many forms, but the UN Protocol highlights four distinct categories:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sexual exploitation</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Forced labor or services</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Slavery, practices similar to slavery, and servitude</strong>;</li>
        <li><strong>The removal of organs</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Each form of exploitation requires tailored strategies for prevention and response.</strong></p>
    <p>The <strong>most prevalent</strong> form of human trafficking in Switzerland is: <strong>sex trafficking (sexual exploitation)</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A 2024 evaluation by GRETA and Swiss authorities reports that <em>“Sexual exploitation remains the predominant form of exploitation, affecting mainly women and girls,”</em> with forced criminality and labor trafficking also increasing <a href="http://state.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state.gov</a> <a href="https://rm.coe.int/greta-evaluation-report-on-switzerland-third-evaluation-round-focus-ac/1680b079a5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rm.coe.int</a> <a href="https://www.act212.ch/en/humantrafficking-1/Formsofhumantrafficking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">act212.ch</a>.</li>
        <li>The NGO ACT212 similarly states that one of the most common forms in Switzerland is <strong>“sexual exploitation – encouraging prostitution”</strong> <a href="https://www.act212.ch/en/humantrafficking-1/Formsofhumantrafficking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">act212.ch</a>.</li>
        <li>Additionally, Swiss police statistics show that about <strong>two-thirds of identified victims</strong> from 2019 to 2021 were trafficked for sexual purposes, compared to the remainder for labor exploitation or criminal activities <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">en.wikipedia.org</a>.</li>

    <h2 id="system-prostitution">4. The System of prostitution</h2>
    <p>The term “system of prostitution” refers to a broad, structured societal framework that is socially embedded, (mostly) legally condoned normalising both: prostitution and societal structures that sustain it, thus presenting systemic obstacles to eliminating human trafficking for sexual exploitation.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Objectifies and commodifies human beings, primarily women, reducing bodies to purchasable goods in a predominantly male‑driven marketplace</strong> (Vancouver Rape Relief & Women's Shelter, <a href="https://sisyphe.org/spip.php?article2370=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sisyphe.org</a>, tlcp.law.uiowa.edu).</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforces gendered and economic dominance, perpetuating the notion that women’s bodies are available for purchase</strong> — a reflection of entrenched patriarchal dynamics (<a href="https://rm.coe.int/shadowreport-switzerland/1680a45421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Council of Europe</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Sustains and fuels human trafficking, especially for sexual exploitation;</strong> normalization and regulation of prostitution create demand that traffickers exploit (fondationscelles.org, <a href="https://rm.coe.int/shadowreport-switzerland/1680a45421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Council of Europe</a>, Brieflands).</li>
        <li><strong>Is supported and legitimized by legal, regulatory, and cultural systems,</strong> including state frameworks, NGOs, academia, media discourse, and public attitudes — which may unintentionally perpetuate the trade (<a href="https://rm.coe.int/shadowreport-switzerland/1680a45421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Council of Europe</a>).</li>

    <h2 id="equality-model">5. The Equality Model</h2>
    <p>The Equality Model, also known as the Nordic or "End Demand" Model, is a legal framework that addresses prostitution and sex trafficking from a human rights and gender equality perspective. Its core principles are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Decriminalizing the prostituted person:</b> It recognizes that those in prostitution are often victims of circumstance or coercion and should not be punished. Instead, they are offered support services to help them exit the system if they choose.</li>
        <li><b>Criminalizing the buyers and exploiters:</b> The model makes it illegal to buy sex and penalizes pimps, brothel owners, and traffickers who profit from the system.</li>
        <li><b>Reducing demand:</b> By targeting the demand for paid sex, the model aims to shrink the overall market for prostitution, making it less profitable for traffickers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Countries like Sweden, Norway, Canada, and France have adopted this model and have not only seen a reduction in the demand for prostitution which in turn has decreased the number of potential victims of human trafficking for sexual exploitation.</p>
