    <h2 id="about-trafficking">1. About Human Trafficking</h2>
    <p>
    Human trafficking is a modern form of slavery and a grave violation of human rights. [5] It is defined as the recruitment, transportation, harboring, or receipt of persons by means of threat, force, coercion, or deception for the purpose of exploitation. [3, 4, 5] This exploitation can take many forms, including forced labor, sexual exploitation, forced marriage, and organ removal. [10] Traffickers prey on vulnerable individuals, often profiting from their exploitation. [3] This crime can occur both within a country's borders and across international lines. [5]
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="sexual-exploitation">2. Human Trafficking for Sexual Exploitation</h2>
    <p>
    Trafficking for sexual exploitation is one of the most common forms of human trafficking globally and in Switzerland. [17] Victims, predominantly women and girls, are forced into prostitution, pornography, or other forms of commercial sexual activity. [4, 10] Traffickers use manipulation, violence, and threats to control their victims. [28] In Switzerland, victims often come from Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America, drawn by false promises of a better life or a good job. [15, 18] The reality they face is one of debt bondage, confinement, and severe psychological and physical trauma. [22]
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="link-prostitution">3. The Link between Human Trafficking and Prostitution</h2>
    <p>
    Prostitution and sex trafficking are inextricably linked. [12] While not all individuals in prostitution are trafficked, the vast majority of trafficking for sexual purposes ends in prostitution. [12] The demand for paid sex creates a profitable market for traffickers, who then supply vulnerable individuals to meet this demand. [12, 25] Legal or tolerated prostitution markets can expand the overall sex industry, which in turn can increase the scale of human trafficking. [16, 24] It becomes extremely difficult to distinguish between voluntary and forced prostitution, providing a cover for traffickers to operate. [16]
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="system-prostitution">4. The System of prostitution</h2>
    <p>
    The system of prostitution is built on a foundation of inequality and exploitation. [30] It treats human beings, mostly women, as commodities to be bought and sold for sexual acts. [30, 32] This system is often controlled by pimps and organized criminal networks who profit from the exploitation of others. [28] The environment of prostitution is inherently violent, with studies showing that a high percentage of those in prostitution experience physical assault, rape, and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at rates comparable to combat veterans. [16] The system normalizes the idea that buying sexual access to another person's body is acceptable, which fuels the demand that drives sex trafficking. [25]
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="equality-model">5. The Equality Model</h2>
    <p>
    The Equality Model, also known as the Nordic or "End Demand" Model, is a legal framework that addresses prostitution and sex trafficking from a human rights and gender equality perspective. [7, 11] Its core principles are:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Decriminalizing the prostituted person:</b> It recognizes that those in prostitution are often victims of circumstance or coercion and should not be punished. [2] Instead, they are offered support services to help them exit the system if they choose. [9]</li>
      <li><b>Criminalizing the buyers and exploiters:</b> The model makes it illegal to buy sex and penalizes pimps, brothel owners, and traffickers who profit from the system. [6]</li>
      <li><b>Reducing demand:</b> By targeting the demand for paid sex, the model aims to shrink the overall market for prostitution, making it less profitable for traffickers. [6, 9]</li>
    </ul>
    Countries like Sweden, Norway, Canada, and France have adopted this model and have seen a reduction in street prostitution and human trafficking. [11]
    </p>

    <h2 id="facts">6. Know the facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In Switzerland, sexual exploitation remains the most identified form of human trafficking. [17] Between 2019 and 2023, Swiss police identified 295 victims. [17]</li>
      <li>The majority of identified trafficking victims in Switzerland are women and girls (95% in 2019), many of whom are under 24 years old. [12]</li>
      <li>Globally, an estimated 80% of all trafficking victims are women and girls, and up to 50% are minors. [16]</li>
      <li>Research has shown that countries where prostitution is legal are associated with higher inflows of human trafficking. [24]</li>
      <li>A study of prostituted individuals in nine countries revealed that 89% wanted to escape prostitution but had no other options for survival. [16, 20]</li>
    </ul>
