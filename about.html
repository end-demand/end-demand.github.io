    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <section id="who-we-are" class="section-separator">
        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>End Demand Switzerland (EDS) is a non-profit organization governed by the Swiss Civil Code and recognized as an NGO of public utility. We are all unpaid volunteers and receive no government funding.</p>
        <p>EDS’s overall objective is to reduce - ideally abolish - trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation in Switzerland.</p>
        <p>To achieve its objective, EDS promotes strategies that focus on the root causes of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation and prostitution. In particular, the demand for commercial sexual acts. Without this demand there would be no trafficking for sexual exploitation.</p>
        <p>EDS’ perspective on human trafficking for sexual exploitation is guided by the experience of survivors, who are part of our NGO and those with a direct insight into the sex industry, such as the police controlling the red-light district and street workers who regularly visit brothels and women in street prostitution.</p>
        <p>Based on the principle of gender equality and the dignity of the human being, EDS sets out to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Raise awareness about the root causes of human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation and prostitution.</li>
            <li>Raise awareness about the way in which prostitution policies impact human trafficking for sexual exploitation in Switzerland.</li>
            <li>Inform about the reality of prostitution, its damaging physical and psychological effects, and the harm that the normalization of prostitution causes society.</li>
            <li>Support women who wish to exit prostitution, whether they fall into the legal definition of victims of human tracking for sexual exploitation or not.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="why-end-demand" class="section-separator">
        <h2>Why ‘end demand’?</h2>
        <p>Switzerland has ratified CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women) in 1997 and is therefore legally bound by its provisions.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>CEDAW Art. 6 states:</strong> “State Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The CEDAW Committee issues General Recommendations which are drafted to interpret articles and serve as guidelines for States.</p>
        <p><strong>General Recommendation no 38 states:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><em>“Strategies aimed at preventing trafficking must take into account demand as a root cause. Failure to recognize the demand is acknowledged to be one of the barriers to States addressing human trafficking”</em> (point 29).</p>
            <p><em>“Sexual exploitation persists due the <strong>failure</strong> of State parties to effectively discourage the demand that fosters exploitation and leads to trafficking”</em> (point 30)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>The latest Concluding Observations (2022) for Switzerland states:</h3>
        <blockquote class="quote-box">
            <p><strong>E. Principal areas of concern and recommendations</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Trafficking and exploitation of prostitution</strong></p>
            <ol start="45">
                <li>The Committee is concerned about the high incidence of exploitation of women in prostitution in the State party. It notes with concern that approximately 85 - 95 percent of women in prostitution are migrant women, often in an an irregular situation. It also notes with concern that an increasing number of women and girls who reside in the State party are lured into the prostitution industry through the so-called “loverboy” method. It further notes with concern:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>The link between trafficking and exploitation of prostitution, with an estimated majority of women in prostitution having been trafficked into the State party;</li>
                        <li>Reports that women in prostitution are regularly subjected to psychological and physical gender-based violence, and that, according to a 2010 study by the Department of General and Social Psychiatry at the University of Zürich, many women in prostitution were displaying mental disorders related to gender-based violence and “the burden” of prostitution;</li>
                        <li>That there is no system in place to help women in prostitution to leave prostitution if they wish so.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The Committee recommends that the State party:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Carry out education and awareness-raising programmes to sensitize women and men on the high exposure of women in prostitution, in particular migrant women, to gender-based violence, exploitation and racial discrimination, develop prevention strategies, and reduce the demand for prostitution in the State party;</li>
                        <li>Provide exit programmes, including alternative employment opportunities, to women who wish to leave prostitution and ensure that these programmes include their children;</li>
                        <li>Ensure that women who leave prostitution have access to shelters and adequate support services.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </blockquote>

    <section id="what-we-want">
        <h2>What do we want?</h2>
        <p>Demand for prostitution leads to human trafficking for sexual exploitation.</p>
        <p>Prostitution policies must therefore focus on reducing demand.</p>
        <p class="arrow-text"><strong>No Demand for prostitution → No human trafficking for sexual exploitation</strong></p>
        <p>International law is clear: Switzerland has a legal obligation to reduce demand.</p>
        
        <h3>Demand for what?</h3>
        <p>The <strong>OSCE (HL!)</strong> puts it this way:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><em>concept of demand that moves beyond only the “demand for trafficking” or the “demand for sexual exploitation,” to address demand that encourages exploitation that in turn leads to trafficking. This creates an obligation to discourage demand that extends beyond the knowing use of trafficking victims to any act that encourages exploitation of the prostitution of others.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The <strong>CEDAW Committee</strong> says to the Swiss State: <strong>reduce the demand for prostitution</strong></p>
        <p><strong>We need policies in Switzerland that focus on reducing demand for prostitution effectively.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Why? Because without the demand for prostitution there would be no human trafficking for sexual exploitation.</strong></p>
        <p>The Palermo Protocol (Art.9.5), the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (2005) Art. 6., the OSCE <a href="https://www.osce.org/cthb/510278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Discouraging the Demand That Fosters Trafficking for the Purpose of Sexual Exploitation.” (2021)</a> repeats this obligation.</p>
        
        <hr style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        <h3>What is the “<em>demand that fosters exploitation and leads to trafficking</em>”?</h3>
        <p><strong>It is the demand for prostitution.</strong></p>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p><strong>Most Swiss women have sufficient acceptable options so that they do not need to turn to prostitution for a living.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>But in Switzerland men’s demand to buy women for sexual acts is high.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>This is why migrant women from low income GDP countries constitute the 85-90% of women in prostitution.</strong></p>
