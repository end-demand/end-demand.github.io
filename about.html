        <h1>About End Demand Switzerland (EDS)</h1>

        <section id="who-we-are">
            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>End Demand Switzerland (EDS) is a non-profit organization governed by the Swiss Civil Code and recognized as an NGO of public utility. We are all unpaid volunteers and receive no government funding.</p>
            <p>EDS’s overall objective is to reduce - ideally abolish - trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation in Switzerland.</p>
            <p>To achieve its objective, EDS promotes strategies that focus on the root causes of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation and prostitution. In particular, the demand for commercial sex. Without this demand there would be no trafficking for sexual exploitation. EDS’ perspective on human trafficking for sexual exploitation is guided by the experience of survivors, who are part of our NGO, and those with a direct insight into the sex industry, such as the police controlling the red-light district and street workers who regularly visit brothels and women in street prostitution.</p>
            <p>Based on the principle of gender equality and the dignity of the human being, EDS sets out to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Raise awareness about the root causes of human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation and prostitution.</li>
                <li>Raise awareness about the way in which prostitution policies impact human trafficking for sexual exploitation in Switzerland.</li>
                <li>Inform about the reality of prostitution, its damaging physical and psychological effects, and the harm that the normalization of prostitution causes society.</li>
                <li>Support women who wish to exit prostitution, whether they fall into the legal definition of victims of human tracking for sexual exploitation or not.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="what-we-do">
