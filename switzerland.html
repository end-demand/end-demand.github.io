        <h1>The Prostitution Debate in Switzerland</h1>

        <section>
            <p>The debate on prostitution in Switzerland is conducted superficially. The public has not seriously engaged with this topic. For the most part, politicians therefore see no need to change Swiss prostitution policy.</p>
            <p>There are several reasons for this, foremost among them being the obscuring of the question of what is actually at stake.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Key Questions</h2>
            <p>Primarily, the question arises: what information do we need in order to take a position? Which information is important but secondary?</p>
            <p>The fact that there are relatively few facts and figures regarding prostitution, on which an analysis of the current situation could be based, makes dealing with the topic more difficult—but it should not paralyze action.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>The Starting Point: A Social Evil or Not?</h2>
            <p>Fundamentally, lawmakers must decide whether they consider the practice of prostitution to be a social evil or not.</p>
            <p>If they see it as an evil, they design the rules to contain prostitution, or to reduce it permanently, ideally to make it disappear. A parallel example is rape/violence: since there is societal consensus that rape/violence must be combated, it has been criminalized with the aim of reducing it, ideally eradicating it.</p>
            <p>The consequence of current prostitution policy is a policy that promotes prostitution.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>The Role of the Media</h2>
            <p>The largest Swiss daily newspaper, the NZZ, has published around X articles in the last 10 years relevant to prostitution. X% of these dealt with prostitution abroad, Y% with prostitution in Switzerland, and the rest in other contexts.</p>
            <p>So, enough is being written. But: to what extent are these articles relevant for forming an opinion?</p>
            <p>Why are there no former sex workers participating in the debate?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Overarching Question</h2>
            <p>What argues in favor of a policy that promotes prostitution? What argues against it?</p>
