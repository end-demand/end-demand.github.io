        <h2>The Swiss prostitution policy</h2>
        
        <h3>The Main Policy Models</h3>
        <p>The Swiss prostitution policies should be seen in the context of the main existing prostitution policy models, which can be described as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Equality Model</strong> (Decriminalisation of the seller combined with buyer-criminalisation)</li>
            <li><strong>Full criminalisation</strong> (Prohibition: Both selling and buying of sexual acts are illegal)</li>
            <li><strong>Legalisation / regulation</strong> (Prostitution is legal, but regulated (licensing, zoning, etc.))</li>
            <li><strong>Full decriminalisation</strong> (Decriminalisation of both, the seller and buyer)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>It is important to understand that Legalisation (regulation) models may in practice be very similar to full decriminalisation.</em></p>
        <p><em>The reason for this is that both are based on the idea that prostitution should be seen as a legitimate employment opportunity. When prostitution is regulated we must bear in mind that this becomes illusionary when evidence shows that regulation is in practice not adhered to.</em></p>

        <p>üëâThis can be illustrated by Germany: According to conservative estimates there are <a href="https://www.hss.de/publikationen/der-neue-deutsche-weg-pub2284.pdf">250.000 people</a> in prostitution, the vast majority of which are women. Despite the obligation to register (= regulation policy) only <a href="https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Soziales/Prostituiertenschutz/Tabellen/prostitutionstaetigkeit2024.html">32,254 people</a> were effectively registered as of 31 Dec 2024.</p>
        <p>üëâ<strong>This means that approximately 90% <em>ignore</em> the obligation to register which in turn renders regulation policy illusionary in practice.</strong></p>

        <h3>Switzerland‚Äôs Policy: Legalisation / Regulation</h3>
        <p>Switzerland legalised prostitution nationally in 1942. It has a liberal prostitution policy and follows a regulatory model: prostitution is legal. Only since 2013, it has become a crime to <a href="https://www.news.admin.ch/de/nsb?id=52245">pay for sex with minors</a>.</p>
        <p>Cantons and cities set most of the practical rules. They decide where prostitution may occur (zoning), whether and how premises are licensed, and what operating conditions apply. Many cantons also require registration with police or local authorities before working (for example, the Canton of Fribourg). Enforcement and details therefore <a href="https://www.newsd.admin.ch/newsd/message/attachments/80658.pdf">vary considerably</a> from canton to canton.</p>
        <p>Due to the general <a href="https://www.parlament.ch/centers/eparl/curia/2012/20124162/Bericht%20BR%20D.pdf#page=46">lack of countrywide data</a> on prostitution (see <a href="https://www.parlament.ch/centers/eparl/curia/2012/20124162/Bericht%20BR%20D.pdf#page=46"><strong>Bericht des Bundesrates in Erf√ºllung der Postulate 12.4162</strong></a>), a calculation corresponding to the one above for Germany is impossible. It may be questioned if regulation works as intended when the data needed to verify this is missing.</p>
        <p>In practice, prostitution takes increasingly place in <a href="https://www.fedpol.admin.ch/dam/fedpol/de/data/kriminalitaet/menschenhandel/berichte/lagebild-mh-schweiz-2024.pdf.download.pdf/lagebild-mh-schweiz-2024-d.pdf">private flats and hotels</a> instead of licensed brothels. This renders an effective control of the sex industry extremely difficult.</p>

    <section id="words">
        <h2>Words We Use</h2>
        <p>The words we use are not always neutral; they shape how we understand the world and influence the way we think about complex issues. Language frames reality, guiding attention toward certain aspects while obscuring others. When we choose particular terms, we are not only describing something but also defining its meaning, setting the boundaries for how it can be discussed and addressed.</p>
        <p>For example, the difference between calling something a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù or a ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù shifts our perception of whether it is threatening or solvable. This is why conscious language is so important: it shapes public discourse, influences policy choices, and ultimately impacts how societies act on the issues they face.</p>
        <p>Below we address certain key terms in the prostitution debate and explain why we use which terms:</p>
        
        <h3>WHY DON‚ÄòT USE THE TERM ¬´SEX WORK¬ª?</h3>
        <p>Conflation with labour rights is misleading. Work implies an activity where the person remains separate from the product (e.g. cleaning, teaching). In prostitution, what is sold is direct intimate access to the body itself and sexual acts, not an external product or service. Calling it ‚Äúwork‚Äù erases the bodily invasion at the heart of prostitution. It also masks structural coercion as the vast majority of women in prostitution come from poverty, migration vulnerability, and/or have a history of abuse. The serious physical and psychological consequences for women and men in prostitution is also why the sex industry cannot be equated with other industrial sectors. The term ¬´sex work¬ª suggests that the sex industry is one industry among others and that it operates independently of gender equality within a society. ¬´Prostitution¬ª allows for the view that it is a system that is based and reproduced by patriarchal structures.</p>
        <p>Also, the term ‚Äúsex work‚Äù contradicts international human rights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CEDAW (Art. 6) and the Istanbul Convention (Art. 6, 18) describe prostitution as a form of exploitation, not work.</li>
            <li>The European Parliament (2014 Resolution) affirms prostitution as violence and gender inequality.</li>
            <li>UN Special Rapporteurs stress that prostitution involves sexual exploitation and acts of violence ‚Äì not labour relations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>WHY DO WE NOT USE THE TERM ‚ÄúSEXUAL SERVICE‚Äù?</h3>
        <p>The term ‚Äúsexual services‚Äù comes from a market vocabulary: it frames prostitution as a neutral similar to providing a haircut or cleaning service. Such terms normalises and banalises the commodification of the human body. What is sold in prostitution is not a ‚Äúservice‚Äù in the sense of an external action; it is the use of a woman‚Äôs body for sexual acts. Prostitution involves the penetration, touching, and use of intimate parts of the body - not something abstract that can be packaged as a ‚Äúservice.‚Äù</p>

        <h3>WHY DO WE NOT USE THE TERM ‚ÄúCLIENT‚Äù FOR MEN* WHO BUY SEX?</h3>
        <p>Using the term ‚Äúclient‚Äù frames prostitution as a legitimate commercial service. This is misleading for several reasons: The word client suggests a neutral, respectable business relationship. However, in prostitution violence is inherent. It is a violation of human rights, not a service industry. The client terminology sanitises the reality of coercion, poverty, trafficking, or other structural factors that lead people into prostitution. Calling buyers, clients shift responsibility away from them, making them appear as passive consumers rather than active exploiters.</p>
        <p>Instead, we use the value neutral term: buyer of sexual acts.</p>
        <p><em>*while we acknowledge that also women buy sexual acts, in the overwhelming majority of cases it is men - not women - who buy sexual acts. We believe that it is therfore justified to highlight this fact by speaking of ‚Äòmen‚Äô</em></p>

            <h3>Piff, Paff, Puff. Prostitution in der Schweiz (Echtzeit) by Aline W√ºst</h3>
            <img src="images/wust.jpg" alt="Book cover of Piff, Paff, Puff" style="max-width:200px; height:auto; float:left; margin-right: 20px;">
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Journalist Aline W√ºst spent many evenings in brothels, froze on the street, celebrated birthdays and New Year‚Äôs with Roxy, Tamara, Saskia, and other women, clicked through hundreds of sex ads, spoke with psychiatrists, police officers, doctors, lawyers, and numerous sex buyers, traveled with Sara to her hometown of Sofia, and bottle-fed the baby of a human trafficker in Bucharest. She asked questions and listened.</p>
            <p>Over the past two years, W√ºst investigated the red-light milieu. She spoke with around a hundred women who are currently prostituted or who in the past earned money through sex. She spent many evenings in brothels, traveled with a Bulgarian woman to her home village, collected money from a sex buyer, froze on the street, and bottle-fed the baby of a trafficker in Bucharest. Piff, Paff, Puff. Prostitution in Switzerland is an impressive reportage in which women in prostitution as well as buyers, brothel operators, lawyers, police officers, doctors, and psychologists all have their say.</p>
            <h4>About the author</h4>
            <p>Aline W√ºst was born in 1986 in Aargau. After training as a bookseller, she studied journalism and corporate communications at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences in Winterthur. She then worked for three years as a reporter at the Aargauer Zeitung. In 2015 and 2016 she traveled the world and portrayed people, among others for the travel magazine Globetrotter. Until 2022 she worked as a reporter for SonntagsBlick. Today she is a freelance journalist.</p>

            <h3>Entmenschlicht ‚Äì Warum wir Prostitution abschaffen m√ºssen (Echzeit) by Huschke Mau</h3>
            <img src="images/mau.webp" alt="Book cover of Entmenschlicht" style="max-width:200px; height:auto; float:left; margin-right: 20px;">
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>At 17, Huschke Mau fled her violent parental home and had nowhere to go. Penniless and without support, she slipped into prostitution and with it into alcohol and drug dependency. Her first pimp: a police officer. It took ten years until she was able to free herself from this vicious cycle.</p>
            <p>Today, Huschke Mau holds a university degree, is pursuing a doctorate, and calls for society to exit prostitution. Her thesis: prostitution always entails sexual violence. Women in prostitution usually have no choice, as they are in dependency or dire situations. Buyers, however, do. No one forces them to purchase women. It is not the women who should be criminalized or shamed, but the men.</p>
            <p>In her book, Mau explains and describes the system of prostitution: how women get into it, why it is so hard to leave, what traumas they experience there, and what is problematic about society‚Äôs and media‚Äôs views of prostitution.</p>
            <p>‚ÄúI believe with this book I have stripped myself more than I ever did during my time in prostitution. I could have simply closed that door to the past and never looked back. But I cannot. I simply cannot walk past all the taxis driving brothel ads through my city. I cannot not read the newspaper articles about underage girls found in brothel raids. I cannot ignore that so many women and girls are still in prostitution, that violence is done to them, day after day.‚Äù</p>
            <p>Prostitution, Mau argues, is the result of discrimination, misogyny, violence, and poverty. She herself was prostituted for ten years.</p>
            <h4>About the author</h4>
            <p>Huschke Mau is a doctoral student, activist for the Nordic Model, and founder of the network Ella, an independent advocacy group for women in prostitution. She runs a blog and writes regularly for magazines and newspapers. She is currently pursuing her doctorate at a university in eastern Germany.</p>

            <h3>Die Strafbarkeit von Menschenhandel in der Schweiz ‚Äì Analyse und Reformbedarf von Art. 182 StGB (Schulthess) by Annatina Schultz</h3>
            <img src="images/schultz.jpeg" alt="Book cover of Die Strafbarkeit von Menschenhandel in der Schweiz" style="max-width:200px; height:auto; float:left; margin-right: 20px;">
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Human trafficking is prohibited under Art. 182 of the Swiss Criminal Code. However, the statute does not clearly define what human trafficking actually is. This complicates not only prosecution and judicial assessment of the crime, but also the identification of potential victims.</p>
            <p>This work therefore focuses primarily on the interpretation of Art. 182 SCC, with particular attention to requirements from key international treaties against human trafficking. It also examines relevant cantonal case law from 2012‚Äì2018 in detail.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the author makes concrete reform proposals for Art. 182 and 195 SCC and suggests the creation of a new offense covering labor exploitation.</p>
            <h4>About the author</h4>
            <p>Annatina Schultz (born May 5, 1977, in Thun; citizen of Basel and Thunstetten) is a Swiss lawyer and sport climber. Since April 2025 she has been Attorney General of the Canton of Bern.</p>

            <h3>Prostitution im Schweizer Strafrecht ‚Äì Die Strafbarkeit von Prostituierten, Zuh√§ltern und Freiern (Schulthess) by Kathrin Heinzl</h3>
            <img src="images/heinzl.jpeg" alt="Book cover of Prostitution im Schweizer Strafrecht" style="max-width:200px; height:auto; float:left; margin-right: 20px;">
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Hardly any other social phenomenon is debated as controversially and emotionally, both historically and today, as prostitution. It is a social reality‚Äîwhether one views it positively, negatively, or tolerates it as a necessary evil.</p>
            <p>Looking back, no state or government has ever succeeded in abolishing prostitution, despite numerous attempts.</p>
            <p>This book addresses the phenomenon and the criminal liability of actors under prostitution law and finally takes a look at the future. Written by a prosecutor for practitioners, affected persons, and those interested, it is also intended to contribute to the political discussion.</p>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Switzerland has been criticized because in cases of human trafficking and promotion of prostitution, unconditional prison sentences are rarely imposed. Is the case law on human trafficking effective at all, are sentences too lenient, or are there pitfalls in prosecution?</p>
            <p>Answers are provided in an analysis of case law on human trafficking and promotion of prostitution from 2007‚Äì2011. Accounts of miserable living conditions of trafficking victims abound. But are women always exploited from disastrous circumstances? Or are all prostituted women victims of trafficking? Who actually becomes a victim?</p>
            <p>Numerous interviews with prostituted women and trafficking victims provide a scientifically grounded picture of patterns and findings.</p>

            <img src="images/rommelfanger.jpg" alt="Book cover of Sexkauf" style="max-width:200px; height:auto; float:left; margin-right: 20px;">
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>This work subjects current German prostitution legislation (ProstG in conjunction with ProstSchG) to a legal-ethical and constitutional review by recognized experts. The assumption of voluntary sex sale is questioned, as is the supposed right of prostituted persons to sexual self-determination with regard to their dignity.</p>
            <p>First, prostitution‚Äôs legalization is placed in an international and European legal context, and the social and personal consequences for those affected are examined. Finally, the issue of human dignity in prostitution is answered from a legal-ethical standpoint.</p>
            <p>In a second step, existing legislation is reviewed for its constitutionality in light of basic rights, especially the human dignity clause of Art. 1 of the Basic Law and the general right to personality, and the question of a fundamental reorganization is discussed.</p>
            <p>With contributions by Dr. Jakob Drobnik, Prof. Dr. Elke Mack, and Prof. Dr. Ulrich Rommelfanger.</p>
            <h4>About the author</h4>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Treating human trafficking and prostitution as separate issues is absurd, because the prostitution system constantly relies on supply through trafficking. The lack of success in combating trafficking is not due to insufficient effort by enforcement authorities.</p>
            <p>Germany considers itself a constitutional state and respects international norms, yet it offers some of the best conditions for sexual exploitation and enslavement of women. Experts even speak of a culture of impunity.</p>
            <p>Why then do our laws against human trafficking not work? This question is explored with Helmut Sporer, senior police officer who for many years led investigations in the prostitution system, and Dr. Jakob Drobnik, who has researched legal systems in relation to trafficking in several European countries.</p>
            <p>The book examines cooperation between prosecutors, police, and judiciary, and discusses which laws are truly needed to achieve success in combating trafficking.</p>
            <h4>About the author</h4>
            <p>Dr. Jakob Bernhard Drobnik (born 1986) is co-author of the study Sex Purchase ‚Äì A Legal and Ethical Examination of Prostitution. Since 2023 he has worked as a project leader in the field of trafficking at Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ, where since 2017 he has taught international law, trade law, patent, and civil law.</p>
            <p>From 2016 to 2020 he was a research associate at the University of Erfurt. From 2005 to 2014 he studied theology, philosophy, and law at the University of Pozna≈Ñ.</p>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Sexuality is more than just sex‚Äîit is about roles, rules, and rights. How free, equal, and sexually self-determined are women in the 21st century? Has female sexuality emancipated or merely masculinized? How much do women really know about their own sexual identity?</p>
            <p>What is considered ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù and who decides that? To answer these questions, Sandra Konrad traces the history of female sexuality and unmasks gender stereotypes that remain influential today.</p>
            <p>She combines psychohistorical insights with current research from sexology and numerous interviews with young women, showing how unconscious role expectations still shape experiences in the bedroom.</p>
            <h4>About the author</h4>
            <p>Dr. Sandra Konrad is a psychologist and has worked for over 20 years as a systemic individual, couple, and family therapist in her own practice in Hamburg.</p>
            <p>In her scientific and therapeutic work she investigates transgenerational transmissions‚Äîthe strong influence of the past on the present. At Piper Verlag she has published Das bleibt in der Familie, Das beherrschte Geschlecht, Liebe machen, and most recently Nicht ohne meine Eltern.</p>
